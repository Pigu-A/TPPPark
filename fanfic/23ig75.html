<h1>Shellock Holmes, The Beggining</h1>
<!--  l4zyhero -->

<p>There’s always the one day, you know something is going to happen. You wake up one morning, the sun shines, and it hits the floor just perfectly enough that you know something that will change your world will happen. Today wasn’t one of those days. Today, I woke up at my usual time, and dragged my sorry shell down to my office a couple blocks away. The sky was gray, the wind brought an ominous chill down the street, and I rushed into the haven. </p>

<p>My name, it’s plastered on the door, in big black letters. Not that anyone bothers to read it anymore, seeing as no one came around. Shellock Holmes, Private detective.  That’s what I was anyway, an old grizzled vet off the police, until a stray bullet seed smacked me in the knee. Speaking of that knee it was tingling, just around noon. It was a feeling I hadn’t felt in a long time.</p>

<p>I counted the seconds, and sure enough my old knee doesn’t lie. There was a quiet knock on the door. The kind that tree outside yer window does when the wind blows hard enough. </p>

<p>“One sec,” I called out. I reached for my drawer and pulled out my blue six shot water gun. An old friend, the very same I used on the force. I checked it’s chamber, six water pulses ready to fire. I slipped it into the holster at my side. Then I quickly patted my pocket, sure enough my Admiral’s Steel knife was tucked away, just where I left the bugger. “Come in,” I called to my waiting client. </p>

<p>She walked in like a calm breeze on the beach. Her scales glinted in the light that passed through my half open blinds. They were yellow, like those pretty postcards of the beach. “Shellock Holmes?” she asked, her voice small, but firm, commanding. </p>

<p>I nodded. Then I realized the temperature in the room felt warmer, as if she carried some sort of flame with her. “The one and only,” I told her picking up my bubble pipe, and blowing out a few bubbles, “How can I help ya?” I sniffed the air, and could smell the quaint perfume she wore. An expensive brand, with a hint of orange, she smelled cleaner then the air around here. I would know, my nose never lies.</p>

<p>“I have… a request,” The sandslash said her arms folding in front of her. She seemed to carry the world on her shoulders, her eyes glinted, and I could tell this girl would be trouble. “I want you… to find someone whose gone missing.”</p>

<p>“Sounds more like a job for the police.” I retort as I kicked my feet onto my desk. </p>

<p>“I’ve already been to them… they won’t take the case.” She replied quickly. “Seems like no one will around here, though that isn’t a surprise.”</p>

<p>“Huh, sounds like trouble.” I hadn’t had a case in a while, and this one piqued my curiosity. “Who is it you want me to find?” </p>

<p>“You know him, or I’m sure you’ve heard of him.” She replied. She looked down at the ground, then back up to me, the fire in her eyes blazing. “Meow Zedong.”</p>

<p>The room was silent then for a moment as the name settled on my chest. The politician Meow was missing? He was the leader of a bunch of crazies, or at least they called them crazies. He was a mon for the common mon, equality and all that. Nothing that fit my taste, politics were always… a sticky business with me. “The Meow Zedong?” I asked, to make sure I had it right.</p>

<p>“Yes, That Meow Zedong.” The Sandslash sighed. “He’s missing, I’ve been able to cover it up, but…” She sighed, “The people, his people are wondering where he is. I can’t keep them fooled for very much longer. I have to protect them until he comes back.” She glared at me, as if she wanted me to call her out, tell her she was crazy. Luckily I was smarter than that. </p>

<p>“It sounds like an interesting case,” I told her, “I’ll take it.”</p>

<p>“You…. You will?” She asked, the shock was apparent on her voice. I wasn’t surprised. “He… He has a lot of enemies, taking this job means you’ll have the same ones,” she warned, “You’ll be making enemies of very powerful people.”</p>

<p>I laughed, “You’re not doing a good job of selling this case to me, not that it matters.” I set my feet flat on the floor and leaned forward, “Making enemies is just part of the business.” </p>

<p>The sandslash smiled, “Well, Shellock Holmes, you do have Guts.”</p>
