<p>Prince: General. May I speak with you?</p>

<p>General: Yes. Please, come in Ome. What is on your mind?</p>

<p>Prince: It's just, why are so many people coming for you? What is going on?</p>

<p>General: <em>sigh</em> It, is a long story. It didn't used to be this way. I used to just be myself. No responsibility, no care. I was young, happy, and thought I would always be that way. Then, it all changed.</p>

<p><em>Flashes back to when Admiral was killed</em> </p>

<p>General: Admiral fell. I was his good friend, and he fell before my eyes, and he told me, "Gator, you must lead them. They need a strong leader, like you." I decided I would honor his words, and fight on. I would be the leader I should be. So, I gave up my young childish ways, and grew up. But, something happened. As I became more confident and grew older, people started calling for my blood. They believed I was simply craving power. They thought I was getting too strong. I was simply getting strong to try and be a good leader. But others thought I was trying to take over. In one attempt to destroy me, we lost Colonel. It was painful to see. But, I knew we had to forge on. Yet, the memory still haunted me. I wanted to be a leader, and yet I allowed one under me to fall. <em>sigh</em> I wonder, maybe I should just give in. Am I causing all this trouble? I don't want any more under me to fall for my sake. Maybe, I should let them take me.....</p>

<p>Prince: General, no. Don't listen to them. They simply crave blood for blood's sake. If you give in, they'll get what they want, and will only come back wanting more later. You have to stay on. You're a great leader, and we need you.</p>

<p>General: Maybe. But, maybe I need to just.... <em>rustles heard outside</em> Did you hear that? </p>

<p><em>Cries for blood fill the air</em></p>

<p>Prince: Yes, I hear it. Where are the<em>sees a gun being pulled at General</em> GENERAL, LOOK OUT.</p>

<p><em>Prince dives in front of General as the gun is fired. The bullet does not hit General, as it hits Prince instead, and he starts bleeding out</em></p>

<p>General: no... nnoooo. Nonononon. Not you too. <em>Starts Crying over Prince</em> No. I don't want to lose you too. <em>Cries harder</em></p>

<p>Prince:<em>In dying breaths</em> Ddd... Don't blame yourself..... Please... Continue on..... Fight on. For me..... You're, a great leader.... Fiigghhhttt.... onnnnnnn......... <em>Prince goes limp, and dies</em></p>

<p><em>General, speechless and sobbing clutches Prince tightly in his arms as the rest of the battalion shows up</em> </p>

<p>Shuck: General. What was that?</p>

<p><em>General is speechless, and the rest circle around him the other way. And see what happened</em></p>

<p>Shuck: What.... What happened?</p>

<p><em>Smoochum, arriving late, comes in</em></p>

<p>Duke: What happene<em>sees the lifeless body of Prince</em> No. NO. NOOOO. <em>Goes and rips Prince from General, and clutches him in her arms</em> WHAT DID YOU DO?</p>

<p>General: <em>Still crying but more composed</em> The. The people came again. They wanted my blood. Prince. <em>Sniffle</em> Prince jumped in front of the bullet.</p>

<p>Duke: No. NO. THAT ISN'T TRUE. HE CAN'T BE.....</p>

<p>General: I'm afraid so..... I'm... I'm so sorry....</p>

<p>Duke: <em>sobbing</em> THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT. IF YOU WEREN'T AROUND, HE'D STILL BE ALIVE.... <em>sobbing ever more, Duke leaves General, and stores herself away from the Battalion</em></p>

<p><em>Eevee comes in, replacing Duke</em></p>

<p>Eevee: I... I saw what happened.... What... What now? Do we just give in?</p>

<p><em>General flashes back to what Prince said with his dying words</em></p>

<p>General: No.... We first hold a memorial for him... We give him a hero's goodbye.... Because he was a hero... Then, we honor his wishes. We press on... </p>

<p><em>Raises hand to salute position</em></p>

<p>General: For Prince. May he rest with all the heroes of old.</p>

<p><em>Rest of battalion joins in salute</em></p>

<p>Battalion in unison: For Prince.</p>
