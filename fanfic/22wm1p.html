<h1>So a Chairman, a Hyperbug, and a Flamesplash walk off of a lunar mountain...</h1>

<p>"How this nature ever came to be, I shall never know," spoke Zedong to his compatriots. "All so selfish, so unaware."</p>

<p>"It wasn't Always that-a-way, Meowzie!" Hyperbug chirped, skipping happily alongside as the team made their way off the lunar mountainside. The sheer idea of mountains from the moon had shaken the cat into a near-destructive rage at the absolute chaos of it all. "When things went a-crayze, we all had to find some way to survive. The very idea of trust wasn't ever made aware to me until I became a part of this trainer's team."</p>

<p>"So, you are, mmm, saying that these lands were once a more fertile, communicative place of peace and thoughtfulness?" There was his smile again, and that glint of an iris through thin eyes. It reeked, reeked worse than anything Hyperbug had ever encountered in the wild. And yet it was an alluring glance, one of power, and of revolution. One full of potential."</p>

<p>"I... I don't know. I only know the stories Mum told me... before..."</p>

<p>"Before what, Hybug?" Sandslash muttered loud enough for the group to hear. "There's nothing here but coffee flavored water, and salt flavored leaves." The first time he'd ever spoken up, the group stopped in their tracks to try and make heads or iron tails of what Sandsplash spoke of. He was always grumbling about something incoherant, but it was different than the world around them. He was one of them now, and the Chairman never liked that kind of attitude, never mind the content of his ramblings.</p>

<p>"Yes," proclaimed the cat. "We will put everything right again, with hard work and dedication. We will build a new, glorious region the likes of which the world has never seen before."</p>

<p>"The world tastes like pies, pies of the numbered variety," Flameslash spat out. "Math like that is overrated, and I hated it in the incubary." He nearly tripped over a rock in the road, but rolled gracefully through the motion until he was back on his feet.</p>

<p>"What even is an incubary, Flamesplash?" Hyperbug inquired.</p>

<p>"I came from an incubary, at least that's what the wallpaper there told me." Everchangingname grumbled again. "At least the bars there tasted cloudy. Now everything's so-"</p>

<p>"Enough, comrade," declared Meow Zedong once again. "It would appear we have a... recruitment opportunity. So, who is to do the honors this day, comrades?"</p>
