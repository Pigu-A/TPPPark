<p>“....Where did you even get this TV from?”</p>

<p>“Look, when you’re the master of a giant electric bird-god, where you get things from isn’t really a problem.”</p>

<p>“Fair enough.”</p>

<p>AJ and Red sat atop Mt. Silver, watching the huge screen. In AJ’s lap sat an Espeon. In Red’s, a Flareon.</p>

<p>AJ looked at the Pokemon in Red’s lap. “So… are you sure they’ll come back?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh yeah. Despite what those things say, released doesn’t mean ‘killed.’ Just wait, they’ll come back for you. They’ll understand,” Red replied, petting the Flareon.</p>

<p>“I hope so…” AJ said.</p>

<p>In the time after their battle, the boys had realized that they weren’t so different from each other. Both young trainers had been ripped away from their normal lives and forced to fight to be the best, like no one before them ever was. Both had been through good times and bad, and both were finally free.</p>

<p>“Where do think those voices went, anyways?” AJ asked.</p>

<p>“Probably to some new region, with some new trainer,” Red said. “We’ll probably see something on the news about some kid defeating the… I dunno, Sinnoh league. It’s what the voices do.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, you’re probably right…” AJ agreed. Suddenly, his Pokegear rang. “Hold up Red, I gotta take this. Hello? Oh hey Joey! ...Woah, Joey, calm down! ...WHAT’S on the news?!” After a minute, AJ turned to Red with a dire look on his face. “Channel 5. Now.”</p>

<p>Red complied and changed the channel. It was a news broadcast from the Hoenn region, however, replacing the normal newscaster was a blood-stained girl who seemed to be about the same age as the boys. She seemed to constantly wear a psychotic grin. “Is this thing working? I better not have wasted my time hijacking a broken camera! ...Oh, it IS working? Lovely~!”</p>

<p>“What the…?” the boys muttered almost simultaneously.</p>

<p>“Now, for any of you watching, I’m Slash, your beautiful new master! I’m just warning you to submit to me now, because we wouldn’t want you to meet their fate, would you~?” The camera turned to the unmoving bodies of the original news team, with a Torchic setting them aflame. “Hee hee~! Good Torchic!” the girl giggled. “Oh, and to Red and AJ, the you-know-whos send their greetings. They’ve told me a lot about you two, and if either of you try to interfere, there will be no Gods, Kings, OR ‘mon. Only Slash~!” The girl winked, blew a kiss to the camera, and giggled one last time before everything went to static. AJ and Red just sat there, wide-eyed. After a few moments, the former talked into his Pokegear.</p>

<p>“Yeah, Joey? I’m gonna have to call you back…”</p>
