<h1>Size doesn't matter...?</h1>

<p>Agent 006 was watching Solareon with a smirk. </p>

<p>After letting the two of Napoleon's Pokemon spend some time outside on the Daycare grounds, the old lady who ran the place brought them to this tiny room, so they could "play along now". Of course this part of the facility, where adult pokemon were kept and brought to strictly at schedule,  was on the complete opposite side of the grounds from the playground and the nursery where baby pokemon spent their nights. Humans weren't dumb, after all.</p>

<p>"Though this Flareon might as well be." 006 thought idly. He barely said a word to her since they arrived, avoided all contact, and even now, when they were confined to this small, but comfy room, made his best efforts to stay away from her. Currently he was sitting by the window, looking directly at the Sun.</p>

<p>"Is something the matter, Solareon?"</p>

<p>"No." came the quiet reply.</p>

<p>"Miss your Sunshine, sweetheart?"</p>

<p>"Don't call me that". Solareon stood up on his hind legs and tried pushing on the window to open it.</p>

<p>"Won't work." the Agent remarked.</p>

<p>"How so?" The Flareon glanced at her, but quickly averted his gaze.</p>

<p>"These windows are locked from outside specifically so that Pokemon don't run away. You can't see the lock from inside the room, but believe me, it's there. The lady also locked the room, so we're stuck here". 006 went over to one of the two mattresses lying on the floor of the room and lay down. "Why do you want to open it, anyway?" She wondered.</p>

<p>"Just... hard to breathe in here..." Solareon mumbled and lay down on the other mattress, curling up and covering his nose with his tail.</p>

<p>The Agent narrowed her eyes. This wasn't the way Solareon usually slept, and it didn't escape her keen eye. Sure, he curled up often, but never quite this much. Also, he looked tense, and she had a good guess as to why.</p>

<p>To test her theory the Agent yawned and gave herself a big stretch, turning on her back and "accidentally" showing Solareon all the parts of her body a male Pokemon mind would want to see from this angle. The technique was perfect.</p>

<p>And it worked. The Flareon gasped quietly, staring at her wide-eyed. A shiver went through his body, making all his hairs stand on their ends. He quickly realized it, though, buried his face deep in his paws and closed his eyes.</p>

<p>006 pretended not to notice his reaction and turned on her stomach again. "You know..." She said smugly. "I see why you like Sunshine so much."</p>

<p>"You do?" Solareon asked, though his speech was muffled by his tail.</p>

<p>"Yes." The Bibarel nodded. "She's so fun... So happy... Optimistic... Cute... <em>Small</em>..."</p>

<p>Something in her voice and the way she said the last word made Solareon perk up and look at her.</p>

<p>The Agent smirked. "And you'd rather keep her that way, wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>Solareon blinked. "What do you mean by that?" He said in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Oh please. I'm talking about the reason that Shinx isn't a Luxray yet." 006 said in a dismissive tone. The Flareon just kept staring at her. "Need I spell it out for you?" the Bibarel raised her eyebrow. "You are that reason."</p>

<p>Solareon narrowed his eyes. "How so?"</p>

<p>"Don't think I'm blind. I've seen you two cuddle. The little Shinx, held in your palms, wrapped in your fluffy tail, safe from all the dangers in the world..." The Agent chuckled. "Won't be easy to do when she evolves fully and becomes twice your size."</p>

<p>The Flareon gulped. "Size doesn't matter. I love her, and will love her no matter what size she is."</p>

<p>"So you think. Sunshine thinks otherwise. She's afraid she won't be attractive for you anymore. She's afraid she already is't. You never made a move on her while you two were in the Daycare, did you?" 006 looked at the Flareon. She obviously striked a cord with that guess. "And, really, how can you be so sure you'll be able to treat her well? When she's fully evolved and becomes a Wailord to your Skitty..."</p>

<p>Solareon's eyes widened. "Take that back!" he demanded angrily.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, what?" Agent 006 smiled, amused.</p>

<p>"TAKE. THAT. BACK!!!" Solareon growled, jumping on his feet and baring his fangs.</p>

<p>The Bibarel smirked. "Make me."</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Solareon was a Fire type Pokemon with a fiery temper, and attacking Agent 006 was his biggest mistake. He barely noticed when the scent that plagued him ever since they were put in the Daycare overwhelmed him and instinct took over. The scent of a ready female turned his bites from hurtful to lustful as the Bibarel's moves turned from struggling to affectionate. He loved Sunshine, he really did, but at that moment all he could think of was the female Pokemon before him, the ready Pokemon before him, the Pokemon who was just the right size...</p>

<p>And the next day, when he returned from breakfast that his mate skipped, he realized just what that one mistake has cost him.</p>
