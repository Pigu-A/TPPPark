<h1>Altaria, Rise</h1>

<p>It's light bright as the sun, it's fire, hotter then anything she had ever felt before, it's presence more intimidating and scary then any Pokemon she had fought before. A pokemon that called for her to be replaced.</p>

<p>"Were you the one to awaken me, little bird?" The dragon spoke calmly. "Did you wish to use the power of Amber?" It's eyes fixed themselves on Swablee, ignoring all members of the party to do so. "What would you sacrifice in our name?"</p>

<p>Swablee, sweating, trembling and recalling the history that she'd been taught, began to speak. "For you, lord Amber? No one but myself." Her reply caused the old Charizard to laugh.</p>

<p>"You amuse me, little pokemon." the God's words were nothing if not honest. "But I see power within you, power that has been suppressed by those that take control of your trainer when she wishes it least." He paused for a breath as he examined the Swablu for a final time. "You might just be the one needed to turn the tide."</p>

<p>A single clawed finger reached out, and tapped the small bird on the head. "I grant you all the powers of Amber, and all the responsibility that lies with it, you will be a symbol of hope and balance inside a world of chaos, do you accept?" The god spoke again. "Do you <strong>accept</strong>?"</p>

<p>Swablee didn't need to think about it for more then a minute before the answer came. "I do!" Her tiny voice squeaked out, as strong as her tiny lungs would let her.</p>

<p>"Then it is time for you to rise again, to become the pokemon you were meant to be- as the Archangel of Amber." Charizard smile as flame began to surround them both, and consumed them, by the time it was gone, Charizard was too. but his final words echoed in her ear: "Rise, Altaria."</p>

<p>The evolution she had been wanting since she was young had finally arrived, the power that she felt in her veins, a power she always knew was there, that had been waiting all this time for her... She now understood why she was waiting this whole time, and what her purpose would be.</p>

<p>"Thank you, my god. I will make you proud."</p>
