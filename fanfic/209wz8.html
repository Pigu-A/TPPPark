<p>AJ: <em>over phone</em> "Joey! How are you doing buddy?!"</p>

<p>Joey: "Oh, fine. Fine."</p>

<p><em>Joey was curled up underneath his usual tree, the one he and AJ used to hang out under. He caressed a pokeball in his hands, tapping it on his knee.</em></p>

<p>AJ: <em>hesitantly</em> "Are you okay? You don't sound well..."</p>

<p>Joey: "No no, I'm... I'm fine. Just...... getting over a fever, is all." <em>he sniffs back boogers</em></p>

<p>AJ: "Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. So you haven't been training your Ratatta much then?"</p>

<p>Joey: <em>clearing his throat</em> "No, can't get the little bugger out when I'm... I'm sick, you know?"</p>

<p><em>Joey made a laughing sound, but his face showed no joy.</em></p>

<p>Joey: "So, how have you been doing over there in Kanto? Face any opponents recently?"</p>

<p>AJ: <em>excitedly</em> "Dude, I've taken down three Gyms in three hours!"</p>

<p>Joey: <em>surprised</em> "Really??"</p>

<p>AJ: "These guys are <em>horrible</em> compared to what I had to put up with at the Indigo Plateau!"</p>

<p>Joey: <em>rocking back and forth a bit</em> "I can imagine you got quite a bit of a work out up there. All your pokemon are really strong now I bet."</p>

<p>AJ: "They are! They all did really well!"</p>

<p>Joey: "Well, who do you have with you right now?"</p>

<p>AJ: "Ah, well, LazorGator is dominating! Burrito and Brian are doing really well as well! Like they're matching power with LazorGator!"</p>

<p>Joey: <em>bumping the pokeball against his chin</em> "Cool."</p>

<p>AJ: "And, um, Katie, my Dragonair!"</p>

<p>Joey: "Yeah, I remember you... telling me about her."</p>

<p>AJ: "She and Solid Snake are doing awesome as well!"</p>

<p>Joey: <em>hugging himself</em> "Solid Snake is your....?"</p>

<p>AJ: "My Steelix! He evolved at just the right time."</p>

<p>Joey: "Cool.... and...?"</p>

<p>AJ: "Oh, yeah, Ace is coming into his own too."</p>

<p>Joey: "Ace?"</p>

<p>AJ: "Yeah, my Ratacate! I bet you--"</p>

<p>Joey: <em>squeaking</em> "RATIC---"</p>

<p><em>Joey begins coughing, a lot. He regains his composure after a few minutes, to the sound of AJ worriedly asking if he was alright.</em></p>

<p>Joey: <em>smiling slightly</em> "Yeah, sorry, I'm alright. How's... who? Ace! How's he doing?"</p>

<p>AJ: "Well, um, he's really catching up with the others! He's coming into his own here in the party. Are you sure you're okay, Joey? You don't sound fine..."</p>

<p>Joey: <em>holding the pokeball pressed to his chest</em> "No, I just need a little more rest, is all. Thanks for talking to me, AJ."</p>

<p>AJ: "Anything for you, buddy. You get better now, you hear?"</p>

<p>Joey: <em>genuinely smiling</em> "Yeah, thanks."</p>

<p><em>The phone hung up. Joey sat with the phone to his lips for a long time, gently rocking and laughing to himself a little bit. He looked once more at the phone.</em></p>

<p>Joey: <em>on the verge of tears</em> "A-anything for... for you... too... buddy...."</p>

<p><em>Joey swallowed hard and looked at the pokeball in his hand once more. He pressed it to his lips in a kiss, and then limp-wristedly threw it in front of him. The ball hit the ground and opened. Nothing came out.</em></p>

<p><em>Joey rubbed his neck as the tears began to flow.</em></p>

<p>Joey: "I'll be with you... AJ.... always....... <sup>please come back soon....</sup>" </p>
