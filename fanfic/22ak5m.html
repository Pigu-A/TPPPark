<h1>C3 waits in vain for M4's return</h1>

<p><em>(Some time ago...)</em></p>

<p><em>The sky over the PC POW camp was cold, overcast, and dreary. A fence of electrified barbed wire surrounded the 30-odd small buildings that made up the camp. Dozens of Oddish troops marched double-time through the red dirt and mud to keep their strength up. The only hint of greenery in the area, besides the Oddish themselves, lay several meters beyond the fence.</em></p>

<p><em>C3 paced back and forth, and then looked to the skies once more. He kicked another rock and sat down up against the wall of the nearby building, next to Apostropi, whose hands and feet were bound and whose face was still a bit bloodied. Her voice was slightly nasally due to some of the blood dried in and around it.</em></p>

<p>Apostropi: "You've been at this for six hours now."</p>

<p>C3: <em>irritated, refusing to look at her</em> "What, are you counting the seconds?"</p>

<p>Apostropi: "You haven't given me much else to do."</p>

<p>C3: <em>looking up and staring into the sky</em> "Why did I ungag you again?"</p>

<p>Apostropi:  "I believe you said that you 'wanted to hear me plead for mercy' while you were beating the crap out of me earlier."</p>

<p>C3: "Right... and why haven't I gagged you again?"</p>

<p>Apostropi: "I don't know. Presumably you find it comforting to talk to me while you're waiting for your sweetheart to return."</p>

<p><em>C3 inhaled sharply as he raised his fist to hit her again, but deflated again before doing so, curling up and biting at one of the knuckles of his fist.</em></p>

<p><em>Apostropi drew in breath to say something, but C3 snapped back before she made a sound.</em></p>

<p>C3: "She's coming back, alright?! I know she is..."</p>

<p>Apostropi: <em>sassy</em> "Actually, I was going to ask for some water."</p>

<p>C3: <em>looks at her with a stern expression</em> "No you weren't."</p>

<p>Apostropi: "You right, I wasn't, but I like how I don't even have to say anything anymore for you to argue with me."</p>

<p>C3: "She's going to come back for me. I'm one of her best soldiers! She trusted me! She wants me on her team! She's going to come back for me."</p>

<p>???: "She's not coming back for you."</p>

<p><em>C3's anger flared again as he raised his fist to Apostropi, but then realized that she wasn't the one that said it.</em></p>

<p>C3: "Alpha!"</p>

<p><em>C3 stood quickly to recognize the old psychic attack specialist as he made his way over. He had a long white moustache that came down on either side of his mouth to his chest. His long white hair came down over his shoulders. He had a heavy cloak that was draped over his shoulders and dragging along the ground a couple feet behind him. His military hardware consisted of a black kevlar vest with spoons of various shapes, sizes, and degrees of bending poking out of every pocket. He walked with a large walking stick, though not for support or balance.</em></p>

<p><em>Alpha took his time to sit down against the wall, next to where C3 was sitting moments ago, the young recruit now standing over him.</em></p>

<p>C3: "Alpha... what do you mean?"</p>

<p>Alpha: "Exactly what I said. She's probably not coming back for you. How long ago did she leave? I believe this is the longest we haven't seen of her helicopter..."</p>

<p>C3: <em>stern, rigid</em> "But why wouldn't she come back for me?! I'm one of her best soldiers."</p>

<p>Alpha: "And so was I at one point as well."</p>

<p><em>C3 opened his mouth to protest, but couldn't find a rebuttal.</em></p>

<p>Alpha: "Let me tell you a story: I was once just a wee lad, part of the Abra brigade. I knew M4 back then. She was young, naive, and a romantic, of all things. And she had eyes for only one other. Zexxy."</p>

<p>C3: "Zexxy?"</p>

<p>Alpha: "A young Torchic lad, who had quite a way with the ladies. M4 was smitten, and she and Zexxy were good friends, hoping to be more, I'm sure."</p>

<p>C3: "Why haven't I ever heard of this... Zexxy?"</p>

<p><em>Alpha sighed, and bowed his head. C3 suddenly began having visions: a brash young handsome Torchic troop, the sound of a gunshot, many troops gathered around his splayed body, M4 screaming to the heavens above. C3 reeled backwards several steps, visibly shaking.</em></p>

<p>C3: <em>voice unsteady</em> " ^Oh.... "</p>

<p>Alpha: <em>raising his head</em> "M4 was never the same. I was there; I watched her turn away from everything she ever loved or cared for. She became hardened, holding her emotions in, never feeling, never letting a weakness through. She was afraid that if she ever let her emotional guard down again, it could only be shattered by someone else, and then what would be left of her?"</p>

<p>Alpha: <em>standing slowly</em> "She never trusts anyone anymore. She switches team members around constantly, so she never has the chance to grow attached to anyone. She has a plan to kill everyone she meets if she needs to--"</p>

<p>C3: <em>cutting him off, crying, outraged</em> "That's ridiculous!! Why--"</p>

<p>Alpha: <em>stern, voice raised</em> "I've seen yours prepared, boy! If the short circuit with the powerline doesn't do it, the Rollout into the ground will! I've seen my own, and it's just as ghastly, I assure you."</p>

<p><em>C3 stood, hand over mouth, staring at him for a while, trying hard not to believe. His eyes closed for a moment, and then strayed upward, to the sky, just hoping against hope to see M4's helicopter flying over. Only the dark cloud's threat of rain greeted him. He collapsed to his knees, hugging himself.</em></p>

<p>Alpha: <em>quietly</em> "I'm sorry I had to say that, boy. But you need to not get your hopes up." <em>he turns, and starts walking away</em></p>

<p>C3: "No..."</p>

<p><em>Alpha stopped. Apostropi scoffed.</em></p>

<p>Apostropi: "Kid, seriously, get over her. You heard the old man."</p>

<p>C3: <em>gets up, his tear-stained face stern</em> "No! I---I refuse to accept tha--that this is how she is." <em>shaking, pointing at himself</em> "I'm going to do my <strong>damndest</strong>... to bring out the old M4."</p>

<p>Alpha: <em>leaning on walking stick</em> "And how do you propose to do such a thing?"</p>

<p><em>C3 glanced about the hellish POW camp, examining the poorly constructed buildings, watching some Oddish go through an obstacle course, breathing in the thick haze of Sweet Scent that constantly filled the air since the Oddish troops' arrival.</em></p>

<p>C3: <em>licking his lips</em> "I'm taking over this place."</p>

<p>Apostropi: "What?!"</p>

<p>C3: "I saw Alpha's vision! This place used to be a lot nicer! Since then, it's been <em>perverted</em> by Bill and his <em>traitorous wretches!</em>" <em>indicates Apostropi</em> "And I think if we cleaned this place up..." <em>C3 sighed</em></p>

<p>Alpha: "Let's get to it then! It's not like we're doing anything else!" <em>happily moves off and begins cleaning up some rocks and stray boards with his Telekinesis.</em></p>

<p>Apostropi: <em>skeptical</em> "You seriously think that's going to work?" </p>

<p>C3: <em>head held high, breathing deeply, still shaking</em> "I sure as hell hope so..."</p>
