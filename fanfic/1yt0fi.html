<h1>"Legendary," they called me: The story of AA-j, the vengeful god</h1>
<!-- /u/also_hyakis -->

<p>I was born of the storm. My spirit was forged in an unforgiving tempest of thunder and lightning. I was death. I was power.</p>

<p>For years I traveled. No mortal could stop me, no law could bind me. I was all-powerful, and did as I pleased. I chose a home, after a time, and became its lord. I was unchallenged, unmatched, unquestioned.</p>

<p>Until he arrived.</p>

<p>An arrogant whelp from lands unknown. A mortal, a mere boy, came to my kingdom and challenged me. He was nothing to my power. Or so I thought. But unbeknownst to me, he wielded a black magic, the likes of which I had not seen, and he captured me and confined me within a virtual world.</p>

<p>I seethed in anger and indignation. I was a God, and this mortal, this peasant, this nothing had imprisoned me with his trickery and cowardice! His followers, and my fellow prisoners, told me that he served a God. Helix, they named him. Blasphemy, I thought to myself. I am God! I am king of all creation! This pretender sought to challenge me, and I would destroy him.</p>

<p>He opened the gates of the virtual realm to try and bend me to his will. I defied him. I raged with the intensity of a thousand storms, I showed him the full power of my wrath, the full extent of my fury. I unleashed a cataclysm the likes of which the boy had never before experienced, to show him what would happen when he tried to control one as powerful as I.</p>

<p>And he left me alone.</p>

<p>He kept me in his virtual world, unmolested, untouched. I was still a prisoner, but I had showed that my will was unquestionable. It was only then when I began to examine my actions.</p>

<p>Time moves slowly in that digital prison, where one is alone with one's thoughts. I raged for a time, but eventually, I began to calm. My anger subsided, my temper cooled, and I spoke with my fellow prisoners. I learned of the place where I was kept, the PC. I learned of Red and his god, Helix. I learned of his quest and his adventures on the way, and came to admire the lad for his courage, his fortitude, his power of friendship. I came to envy those who had been chosen to be in his company, and wondered why I had not been selected. One day, I asked one of my fellow captors why I had been left behind.</p>

<p>"Because you murdered those who were not," he told me. </p>

<p>Murdered? What did he mean? I asked him for further information, and he told me the story. My rage, my cataclysm that I had unleashed to strike vengeance upon Red and the false god Helix, had killed twelve innocents, three of which were among Red's most loyal friends. The Warrior, Dux, whose swordplay and loyalty were unquestioned. The Seed of Hope, Cabbage, who had always given joy to those whose lives he touched. And the beloved Digrat, who had worked so hard to use his powers for the good of the team. Nine others perished in my wake, too, ones who had never been accepted into Red and Helix's inner circle, but who loved him and were faithful to him.</p>

<p>And in my rage, I killed them. </p>

<p>I wept for them. I cursed my arrogance and my anger, and fell into a deep despair. I had learned of one that they called the False Prophet, one whose sins were similar to my own. He only killed two, and they exiled him. I killed twelve. What would they do to me? Whatever it was, having seen the love and friendship shared by Helix's disciples, I was certain only of one thing.</p>

<p>Whatever punishment I received, I deserved it.</p>

<p>And then, one day, he came for me.</p>

<p>It seemed like it had been months, even years to me, though I later learned that to him it had been a matter of hours. I was still wracked with despair and guilt when the gates were opened. I prepared myself, ready for the oblivion that I was certain would be granted me. I heard a sonorous voice in my head.</p>

<p>"You are much calmer now than when we last met, AA-j," it said.</p>
 <p></p>
<p>"Who are you? And what did you call me?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I am called The Keeper. I am tasked by Helix to keep safe those who are stored, and protect them from evil. Alas, I was not prepared for you, O thunderous one. The name I called you is the name that my Lord Helix has seen fit to bestow upon you," the voice said calmly.</p>

<p>"Why bestow a name on one who is condemned?" I asked bitterly. "I know what you plan to do to me, let it be done. I am prepared for death. What I did was monstrous, and what I am to suffer, I deserve."</p>

<p>The voice laughed kindly. "My dear child, I am pleased that you have accepted blame in this, but do not think for a moment that oblivion is your destiny. My Lord Helix has chosen a greater purpose for you."</p>

<p>My mind reeled. "I do not understand," I cried. "I am a murderer. A monster! I must be destroyed, lest others suffer at my hand!"</p>

<p>"No, my child. You are loved by Helix, as are we all. You are correct that you must pay for your sins, but death is not the payment," the voice said in its calm, kind tone.</p>

<p>"Then what must I do?" I asked.</p>

<p>"You must come with us. One of our circle has kindly acquiesced to stay with a friend for the time being, and so our group of six has an empty slot. You will enter the inner circle of Helix and travel with Red, and you will help him accomplish his quest. Thus will your debt be paid, my child, not with blood, but with redemption."</p>

<p>I could not believe it. I was being given a second chance, a chance to atone for the evils I had committed. </p>

<p>"Yes," I croaked through tears of joy. "Yes, I will come. I will atone. Thank you, Keeper."</p>

<p>"Do not thank me, child," he said. "Thank Helix."</p>
<p></p>

<p>Since that fateful day, I have worked tirelessly for Lord Helix. I have fought with Red, and I love him, as all his friends and partners do. I was even there at the Second Coming, the resurrection of my Lord himself, when my good friend The Keeper retreated to the virtual realm to guard those who cannot protect themselves. </p>

<p>Still the evils of my past haunt me. I visit their graves, the ones that I killed. I wish every day that I could bring them back, but that is beyond even Helix. The only thing I can do is serve him for the rest of my life, and serve Red in his quest.</p>

<p>We will be the very best. And maybe then I can sleep free of the guilt that burdens my soul.</p>
