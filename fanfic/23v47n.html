<h1>The Freedom of Fire and Water</h1>
<!-- /u/Lavaros -->

<p>The vessel of Old Amber did not need to wait for the PC's monster to come when he searched out it's darkest place. The old Charizard letting out a burst of flame as a pair of red eyes rushed towards it, causing the creature to slink away, if ever so slightly.</p>

<p>"Did you really think you could hurt <em>me</em>, foul creature? You who has no form, no life of it's own? You could never even hope to <em>touch</em> without failing." His voice was low and calm, he wouldn't need to try to provoke the Darkness, his mere presence would do that all on it's own.</p>

<p>"I remember some one like you... no... not like you, you're almost exactly the same... I enjoyed killing that one, do you want to know how she died?"</p>

<p>A voice echoed through the darkness, a Charmeleon from long ago, crying for help.</p>

<p>"Red? What are you doing? Please don't let them win, please don't let them hurt me! Nononono, please, stop! I'm sorry Red! I'll do better next time! <strong>AAAAAH</strong>!" Abby's death. At the hands of the voices, at the hands of this monster. The anger in the Vessel of Amber swelled in his stomach along with disgust. But he kept quiet, he kept cool.</p>

<p>"Was that supposed to frighten me, creature? I know how she died. She is the reason why I am in this form now." He swept his tail as the monster tried to strike again, pushing it backwards once more. "Is this your <em>sad</em> attempt to drive me insane?" Charizard quizzed before scanning the dark for his target, a Quagsire out of time.</p>

<p>"So <strong>that's</strong> who you're here for... too bad he's <strong>MINE!</strong>" The shadow formed into a pokemon with a blade attached to its head, with wings on it’s shoulders, and large, clawed feet ready to pounce on him.</p>

<p>Old Amber readied itself once more, as the fire erupted from his mouth. "You will suffer for that image, foul creature! You will lose to me today! <strong>TODAY YOU FACE A POKEMON WITH THE POWER OF A GOD!</strong>" Charizard roared, and his fire grew hotter and hotter, until it turned blue, but it did almost nothing but stall the beast.</p>

<p>The spectre laughed as it mocked his opponent. "I am so <em>beyond</em> gods now." It grinned, and the puppet charged at the Fire-Type once more, but Charizard didn’t need to brace itself, the time-displaced pokemon had taken the spectre by it’s tail, and threw it what could only be described as skyward, before turning back to his elder.</p>

<p>"Charizard, amber... friend?" Cavesire asked, extending it’s hand, and Charizard met it with his own. </p>

<p>"Yes, young one, I suppose you could consider me a friend." Charizard smiled as his godly powers took hold of them both, and they felt themselves be surrounded by warm light... and familiar pokemon.</p>

<p>"Comrade Wooper! You evolved!" A deep, commanding voice came out of a small Skitty as it scanned the two tall pokemon before it. "And you were put in here, too. Are the others alright, did my plan work?"</p>

<p>Cavesire simply nodded. "Yes Chairman."</p>

<p>Zedong smiled in satisfaction, but his smile did not last long as he looked over the exhausted Charizard. "And who the hell is this?" Another question.</p>

<p><em>Rude little pokemon.</em> Charizard thought, before answering for himself. "I am a Charizard with no name- but I carry the title of Lord Amber."</p>

<p>"Well, Lord Amber." Skitty’s tail-paw patted him on the back. "Welcome to our sanctuary."</p>
