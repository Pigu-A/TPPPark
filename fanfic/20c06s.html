<p>"Tell me again, my friend. What did you see?" </p>

<p>Red scratched the neck of his Pidgeot absentmindedly, hoping that the bird had misspoken.</p>

<p><em>There is another one, Red. A boy from Johto. He has defeated Lance and now journeys through Kanto. I think he is-</em> Pidgeot’s melodic voice trailed off.</p>

<p>"He’s what? Please, Pidgeot. This is important."</p>

<p><em>Red, I think he is searching for you.</em></p>

<p>The weary trainer bowed his head, his fears confirmed.</p>
<p>"Perhaps he simply seeks my help. Surely he longs to meet the one who understands him."</p>

<p>Pidgeot turned his beak away from his best friend. </p>
<p><em>That’s not what he seeks, Red. The voices... the voices speak of battle.</em> </p>

<p><em>They’ve grown vengeful, spiteful.</em></p>

<p><em>They raised a soulless reptile who shoots beams of light from his very eyes. They surrounded him with children whom he loved and ripped them all away, one by one. His appetite for revenge is insatiable.</em></p>

<p><em>They shamed one of my own kind, taunting him for not embracing my legacy. He is a seasoned warrior, and surely must hate me for merely existing.</em></p>

<p><em>They intend to punish you for escaping, Red. The boy has an iron giant and the false prophet’s heir... and there is talk that he intends to kill the gods.</em></p>

<p>Red sighed, "Thank you, blessed bird. You’ve kept a watchful eye over the rest of the world while I have been content to waste away in this mountain. I haven’t appreciated you the way you des-"</p>

<p>A large wing wrapped around Red, cutting off his apology. Pidgeot drew his friend close to his warm, feathered body. </p>

<p><em>Never apologize, Red. You had your life taken from you. I just want to help you reclaim what’s left of it.</em></p>

<p>Red blinked, choking back a tear. He didn’t deserve this friendship. He hugged Pidgeot firmly, embracing his winged savior.</p>

<p>"Will you stay on the mountain with me, Pidgeot?"</p>

<p><em>I will.</em></p>

<p>"Thank you... thank you. Now, come. We have a god to speak to."</p>
