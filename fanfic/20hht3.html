<h1>PART 9: The Aftermath</h1>

<p>It was dark. Red struggled to open his eyes.</p>

<p>He tried wildly to focus his blurred vision, barely recognizing the darkened silhouettes of the six ‘mon who lay around him, unmoving and silent as the grave. A layer of water had covered the cavern floor and droplets fell from the stalactites on the roof of the cavern.</p>

<p>Red tried to move but couldn’t. Everything hurt.</p>

<p>“Are you there, Pidgeot?” Red wanted to cry out. But he couldn’t form the words.</p>

<p>“A...a...ar...a-abby,” he managed to gasp.</p>

<p>Red blacked out.</p>

<p>It was bright. Red struggled to open his eyes.</p>

<p>The gleaming sun shone intensely down, forcing him to shield his face with his hand. Air swirled around him. Gigantic, leathery wings rose up and down on either side of him. Orange wings.</p>

<p>Red sat up quickly. Could it be? He looked around to find himself on the back of an enormous, magnificent Charizard.</p>

<p>“Where am I?” Yelled Red over the rushing wind, trying to get his bearings.</p>

<p><em>Ah, you’re awake. Sooner than I expected.</em> The dragon stared straight ahead, expressionless.</p>

<p>Unimpressed by the lack of an answer, Red opened his mouth to ask again but before he could do so, the Charizard turned its large head to look back at the little trainer. His voice failed him once more.</p>

<p>Red had seen those eyes before, most often in his dreams. They were tired, to be certain, but a glimmer of joy danced like a flame within their gaze. He knew those eyes.</p>

<p>“A...a...a-Abby?”</p>

<p>Charizard turned her head away, and a couple large teardrops flew back with wind, splashing harmlessly on Red’s jacket.</p>

<p><em>I found you, Red,</em> she whispered, barely audible. <em>I found you.</em></p>

<p>Red wrapped his arms around the dragon’s slender neck, with no intention to let go. Soaring high above the Earth, the young trainer from Pallet embraced his long-lost friend, as if the whole world was to be witness to this beautiful moment.</p>

<p>“I’m so sorry,” Red managed to say after a few minutes. “I never meant to leave you, you were always supposed to be there with me. I wasn’t myself when I sent you away, I- it wasn’t fair to you. To me. To anyone.”</p>

<p><em>It broke my heart to leave you,</em> Abby replied, <em>but I left of my own accord. You had warriors to fight for you in battle. You needed an angel to watch over you when you weren’t. After I found all those who you released, I set out to find you. I’ve been following you for a long time, Red. Knowing that you’d need me again one day,</em> another tear fell, <em>and here I am.</em></p>

<p>“I... I don’t know what to say,” Red stammered.</p>

<p><em>Then just hug me for a little while longer, my little friend.</em></p>

<p>So he did.</p>

<p>“Friends...” Red slowly realized. “My friends, Abby! What happened to them? Are they alright?”</p>

<p>Instinctively, he reached down to his belt and found three filled Pokéballs, their inhabitants resting soundly.</p>

<p>The great dragon rumbled with amusement, <em>I was wondering when you’d ask. Look below us.</em></p>

<p>Red peered over Charizard’s scaled sides to see three large figures flying far below them. A purple moth, fluttering almost aimlessly along; a great yellow bird, shooting above the ground like a bolt of lightning; and a humble Pidgeot flapping behind the others, glancing up at the Charizard every few moments. Upon seeing a little face looking down upon him, Pidgeot let out a majestic cry, pumped his wings furiously, and shot past Red in a blur of white feathers. The ecstatic bird climbed higher and higher into the sky, intending to tell the heavens themselves that his best friend had returned.</p>

<p><em>You have shown us all such great love,</em> Abby looked back at the trainer, whose eyes followed his trusty bird among the clouds. <em>Not just to Pokémon, but to other humans as well. The boy has been freed, Red.</em></p>

<p>Red smiled. Somehow he already knew.</p>

<p><em>We’re on our way to Pallet now, you have a few friends waiting for you there.</em></p>

<p>“I should very much like to see them... and my mother too. I’ve been gone for a long time.”</p>

<p><em>And where do you intend to go next, little friend?</em></p>

<p>Red cast his gaze across the green land below, Johto and Kanto both visible from his perch. He turned to the deep, blue ocean that sprawled endlessly into the horizon. He looked up at the sky, boundless and infinite.</p>

<p>“Wherever the wind takes us, Abby. As long as I’m with you.”</p>
