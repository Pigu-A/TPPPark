<p>[The Daycare; The night after One Night Stand]</p>

<p>"How could you?" yelled Sunshine, her eyes burning with rage.</p>

<p>006 only smiled. "It wasn't really that hard. I mean, the two of us, alone, in the Daycare? Practically the perfect scenario for seduction."</p>

<p>"Shut up," barked Sunshine. "You know what I mean. We're supposed to be on a team together, not doing <span class="censor">shit</span> like this behind each others' backs!"</p>

<p>"Would you rather have me do it in front of you then?" asked 006, raising an eyebrow. "I have to say, I never took you for that kind of girl."</p>

<p>Sunshine growled. "<span class="censor">Fuck</span> you!"</p>

<p>"If you'd like," retorted 006 with a wink.</p>

<p>[10 minutes later]</p>

<p>"Oh gooood," moaned Sunshine. "How are you so good at this?"</p>

<p>006 grinned. "Experience, my dear. <em>Lots</em> of experience."</p>

<p>[Later]</p>

<p>"I forgive you."</p>

<p>Solareon looked up in surprise. "W-what?"</p>

<p>Sunshine sighed, sitting down next to Solareon. "I said I forgive you. I get that you love me and all, but there was no way you could have resisted <em>her</em>. I mean, with her suit, and her fingers, and that goddamn smile..."</p>

<p>Solareon raised an eyebrow. "You slept with her didn't you."</p>

<p>"Yes," Sunshine cried, flinging her arms up in defeat. "I'm so sorry Solar, it's just, we were sitting there in the daycare, and she kept smirking, and..."</p>

<p>Solareon sighed, but smiled a little. "I guess it's only fair," he said, putting an arm over Sunshine's shoulders. "Say, I know it was just a pretense from 006, but she really did teach me a few things about making love. Do you want me to-"</p>

<p>"YES," said Sunshine eagerly, her eyes sparkling.</p>

<p>And then they <span class="censor">fucked</span>. And it was glorious.</p>
