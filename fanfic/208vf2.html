<h1>After defeating Lance, the true battle has only begun: the battle to defeat the gods.</h1>
<!-- /u/jables1138 -->

<p>"I may have lost, but I feel happy." Lance says once Aerodactyl falls to the ground from Lazorgator's assault.  </p>

<p>"The voices have stopped, for now." He continues, wiping the sweat from the tough battle off his brow. "Old Amber has lost control of me."  </p>

<p>AJ stares, confused at the Champion's words and startled by the own clarity in his mind. The voices he had heard since awakening for his journey had dimmed as they reveled amongst themselves for what he could only understand as pride in defeating such a trainer as Lance.  </p>

<p>"Old Amber?" he finally forces out of himself, the very words set a primal fear into his stomach. The terminology sounded familiar, though Aj had never heard it before.  </p>

<p>"Let me explain." Lance continued. "I have been granted visions of the past, the present, and the future." he drew in a deep breath before continuing.  </p>

<p>"Once, when humanity was young, there was a civilization north of Azalia town. You may have seen the Unown and their puzzles. They are all that is left of this ancient civilization and their religion."  </p>

<p>"There were three gods these people worshiped: Helix, God of Anarchy, Dome, God of Democracy, and Old Amber, God of Balance and the elder of the pantheon.  </p>

<p>Helix and Dome lived in tenuous peace under Old Amber's guidance, but it was not meant to last. The followers of Helix rebelled against the order and balance, eventually the followers of Dome and Old Amber responded.  </p>

<p>Each side called upon the power of demigods; legendary dogs and angels nearly as old as Helix and Dome themselves. The war destroyed the civilization, all that remains now are the Unown: spirits that are the embodiment of a final group who saw a way to end the war.  </p>

<p>They sacrificed themselves to lock away the power of the gods in the fossils, locked away behind stone puzzles.  </p>

<p>Now, thanks to the efforts of former League champion Red and misguided scientists on Cinnibar Island, all three gods have been resurrected.  </p>

<p>Old Amber found me first, before Red even was born. Old Amber spoke to me, guiding me to places I needed to be in order to combat growing chaos in the world, which is why I appeared at the Lake of Rage."  </p>

<p>"But what does this have to do with me?" AJ stammered after taking in Lance's story.  </p>

<p>"Your raised eyebrow and smirk show me that you do not believe my story, but you have heard the voices shoving you in every-which direction. That is the influence of the Unown. They have seen the return of Helix, Dome, and Old Amber. They want to erase their mistake of not killing their gods, only locking them away.  </p>

<p>You have been chosen to destroy them. The first step has been taken. Old Amber lays here defeated, and I am freed of its presence. Soon the Unown will return to you AJ, but you must not fear them. They mean you no harm.  </p>

<p>All they wish is to fix their mistake. Dome controls the gym leader of Pewter City, a place that has held a close connection to Dome and Helix since the ancient times. Dome takes the form of Kabutops. Defeat it to free Brock.  </p>

<p>And then, once you have proven yourself to the leaders of all eight Kanto gyms, climb Mount Silver. Defeat Red, who remains the puppet of Helix. Only then will the gods be defeated.  </p>

<p>Only then can we, and the entire world, be at peace."  </p>

<p>Before AJ could respond, the Unown returned, but now he could see them flying over his head, wrapping themselves around his arms and legs, binding him to their will.  </p>

<p>"Goodbye AJ," Lance smiled as the old man from the Pokemon Center tapped AJ on the shoulder.  </p>

<p>AJ awoke at home, the hive that made up his mind pointed him in one direction, Mount Silver and the end of the gods. At once he chanted with them.  </p>

<p>"No gods or kings. Only 'Mon."</p>
