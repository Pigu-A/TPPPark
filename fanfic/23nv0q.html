<p>"Damn it man, it's not worth it! We can't let you do this!" Shellock yelled sternly, taking hold of Cavesire and turning him around. "He can't ask you to risk your life like this!"</p>

<p>Cavesire nodded, smiled, and placed a giant hand on the Wartortles shoulder. "Chairman not need to." He spoke calmly, and pushed Shellock away. "The voices... want one of us." Cavesire added sighing at Swablee, and then showing concern to Alice. "They won't hurt Alice, they won't hurt my friends, just to get to me."</p>

<p>"Alice and Swab are kind, Shellock is smart... Flameslash and King are strong... and HyperBug keeps us together." Cavesire had come so far so quickly after evolving, he could speak clearer, and he cared more then ever before about his team. "Mew could be... like me, he needs friends... like all of you."</p>

<p>"But we can't leave you in there all alone!" Swablee cried out, tears filling the young pokemons eyes. "We know what it was like for King, what if the PC comes for you because it knows it can't have him anymore."</p>

<p>"I am strong." Cavesire responded without a second thought, as Hyperbug and FlameSlash looked away in sadness and fear. "Because of you all, I am strong. Thanks to the Chairman, I am strong."</p>

<p>King spoke up, his voice commanding the attention of the team. "It's his choice, we can't pass up a chance to recruit what might just be a living god. Go, kid... fight that thing all you can."</p>

<p>"I will." Cavesire said, as the light of the PC surrounded him, and placed him in it's box, and a voice started to call out to him.</p>

<p>"Welcome to your new <strong>cage</strong>, caveman... you'll not be seeing your friends again."</p>

<p>"You are wrong... monster. I will see them every time I close my eyes... I will see them... in the dark." Cavesire replied with a smirk on it's face. "Do your worst, monsters."</p>

<p>The Darkness began to surround Cavesire, eliminating all light, and for any normal Pokemon, all hope. But for the Quagsire would not stop hoping, not stop waiting to see his friends, no- his family, once more. and as the darkness closed off the last bit of light, Cavesire spoke again. "I am <strong>strong.</strong>"</p>
