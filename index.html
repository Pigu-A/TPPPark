		Okay, so. It's quiet here and I want to talk about stuff.

Question to discuss: If our protagonists were suddenly pokemon, which pokemon would each of them be?

Red: Red was the start of it all, the legacy of tpp. He was the first to be invaded by the voices; he didn't know what was happening, it had never happened to anyone before, and he became empty and soulless, following our every whim. he was more a victim than he was a hero and he never tried to fight back. His character was a grand one, looked at with awe by many, but it is also a sad and weak one. He was poisoned and poisoned all the other who came after him in turn, all the while staying silent and never saying a word. This silence and that dark side of his character hidden behind the shallow facade of magnificence, makes me believe he is a dark type pokemon. He could have been great, but he chose to be a silent slave, staying out of sight, hidden from the world and in the dark, as it were, waiting for AJ to come and beat him. I think Red should be Umbreon. When he started his journey, nobody knew what to expect and it could have been anything, much like an Eevee, But Red chose to turn dark and silent.

AJ: Even though his team was out on the biggest quest we ever gave a tpp team, AJ was really just a kid. His pokemon might have been on this big heroic quest and he might have wanted to face Red at some point in time, but he also mucked around with his phone a lot, tried to drive away the cold and the horrible voices in his head by ice skating in the Ice Path and went back to laugh and play with his friend Joey quite a few times. Out of all the tpp protagonists, I always pictured AJ to be the youngest, and saw him as the only one who really was still a kid. He enjoyed childish things and walked around in stuff that his mom bought him with the money he still wasn't allowed to manage himself, but all of that was okay. I imagine AJ to be a lighthearted pokemon with huge potential, maybe even more than Red, but who's still small. Because of his destiny to rise to greatness, I also imagine him as a flying pokemon, who can soar up in the sky after having learned to fly. So I'm going for either Pidgey or Fletchling.

A: A is a rebel, a fighter. She's a hard-ass, brutally honest in what she says, not very lady-like and doesn't cry or whine easily. She also gets excited and hyped about stuff very easily. While facing the elite 4 she tried to rely on brute strength alone and pushed on even after 100 attempts, with unmovable willpower. So I think she'd be a fighting type pokemon. Seeing how many times I have her punch poor Brendan, I'm going to say Hitmonchan. A physical attacker, straight-to-the-point, punch-in-the-face pokemon.

Alice: The curious type, the cute girl with the cute glasses, interested in pretty much everything. Is a generally happy person, even with the voices in her head, but also seems a little naive at times. With the way she cruised through kanto and its gyms pretty easily, never bothered by the obstacles and researching pokemon of any kind, she comes across as someone very light spirited and free, who avoids conflict when it's not necessary and prefers to study instead. Among our protagonists, she also seemed like the most normal one, without some sort of grand quest (strange huh? a normal person in a randomized world. The whole Bill thing wasn't really that big of a deal compared to what we made AJ do, for example. She was just trying to find her dad, and wasn't even in a big hurry to do that. The randomized world didn't seem to bother her much). So I'm thinking normal or mundane grass type pokemon, preferably one that relies on hp or defense more than offensive strength. One that comes to mind is Audino, but I think that's a little bit too cutesy, even for Alice. So let's go with Chikorita; a curious grass type with decent defense that can use non-offensive moves like light screen, reflect, safeguard and synthesis.

Napoleon: Empoleon, for obvious reasons. I don't think I even really need to go into details; they look the same, sound the same, both try to be dignified as fuck. I know Napoleon only tried to be dignified and usually didn't really succeed, but c'mon. It's perfect. It even has the white scarf/cravat.
