Are you going to add in Qwillix? (If you didn't know, If we had picked Helix it would have become a Qwilfish)

Nah, it's fine. Does he ONLY harden in Stadium. Because... harden's not really a thing that I can simulate (there's no stats in the tiny stadium ^_^;). The most I can make him do is... well... splash like Magikarp, except perhaps without the animation.

But Magikarp vs Metapod will lock the game unless you add Struggle.

Well, Magikarp has Tackle still, but Metapod vs Metapod will lock it certainly... :P

[Stadium]
Bug: Names of pokemon on the screen in/on the stadium tend to appear as the name of the pokemon from the previous match who didn't faint, and beat the last pokemon on the opposing side. 
EDIT: May actually/also be caused by clicking off the tab then going back to it a while later, when different pokemon are battling.
